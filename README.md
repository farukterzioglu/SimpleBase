This is my own take for exotic base encodings like Base32, Base58 and Base85. 
I started to write it in 2013 as coding practice and kept it as a small pet 
project. I suggest anyone who wants to brush up their coding skills to give 
those encoding problems a shot. They turned out to be more challenging than I 
expected. To grasp the algorithms I had to get a pen and paper to see how the 
math worked.

Features
--------
 - Base32: RFC 4648, Crockford, z-base-32, Geohash, FileCoin and Extended Hex 
   (BASE32-HEX) flavors with Crockford character substitution, or any other 
   custom flavors.
 - Base58: Bitcoin, Ripple, Flickr and custom flavors.
 - Base85: Ascii85, Z85 and custom flavors.
 - Base16: UpperCase, LowerCase and ModHex flavors. An experimental hexadecimal 
   encoder/decoder just to see how far I 
   can take the optimizations compared to .NET's  implementations. It's quite 
   fast now. It can also be used as a replacement for `SoapHexBinary.Parse` 
   method since it's missing from .NET Core.
 - One-shot memory buffer based APIs for simple use cases.
 - Stream-based async APIs for more advanced scenarios.
 - Lightweight: No third-party dependencies (depends only on 
   [System.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/) package)
 - Thread-safe.
 - Simple to use.

NuGet
------
To install it from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleBase/):

  `Install-Package SimpleBase`

Usage
------

### Base32

Encode a byte array:

```csharp
using SimpleBase;

byte[] myBuffer;
string result = Base32.Crockford.Encode(myBuffer, padding: true);
// you can also use "ExtendedHex" or "Rfc4648" as encoder flavors
```

Decode a Base32-encoded string:

```csharp
using SimpleBase;

string myText = ...
Span<byte> result = Base32.Crockford.Decode(myText);
// Span<byte> is analogous to byte[] in usage but allows the library
// to avoid unnecessary memory copy operations unless needed.
// you can also use "ExtendedHex" or "Rfc4648" as decoder flavors
```

### Base58

Encode a byte array:

```csharp
byte[] myBuffer = ...
string result = Base58.Bitcoin.Encode(myBuffer);
// you can also use "Ripple" or "Flickr" as encoder flavors
```

Decode a Base58-encoded string:

```csharp
string myText = ...
Span<byte> result = Base58.Bitcoin.Decode(myText);
// Span<byte> is analogous to byte[] in usage but allows the library
// to avoid unnecessary memory copy operations unless needed.
// you can also use "Ripple" or "Flickr" as decoder flavors
```

### Base85

Encode a byte array to Ascii85 string:

```csharp
byte[] myBuffer = ...
string result = Base85.Ascii85.Encode(myBuffer);
// you can also use Z85 as a flavor
```

Decode an encoded Ascii85 string:

```csharp
string encodedString = ...
Span<byte> result = Base85.Ascii85.Decode(encodedString);
// Span<byte> is analogous to byte[] in usage but allows the library
// to avoid unnecessary memory copy operations unless needed.
// you can also use Z85 as a flavor
```

Both "zero" and "space" shortcuts are supported for Ascii85. Z85 is still 
vanilla.

### Base16

Encode a byte array to hex string:

 ```csharp
byte[] myBuffer = ...
string result = Base16.EncodeUpper(myBuffer); // encode to uppercase
// or 
string result = Base16.EncodeLower(myBuffer); // encode to lowercase
```

To decode a valid hex string:

```csharp
string text = ...
Span<byte> result = Base16.Decode(text); // decodes both upper and lowercase
// Span<byte> is analogous to byte[] in usage but allows the library
// to avoid unnecessary memory copy operations unless needed.
```

### Stream Mode

Most encoding classes also support a stream mode that can work on streams, be 
it a network connection, a file or whatever you want. They are ideal for 
handling arbitrarily large data as they don't consume memory other than a small 
buffer when encoding or decoding. Their syntaxes are mostly identical. Text 
encoding decoding is done through a `TextReader`/`TextWriter` and the rest is 
read through a `Stream` interface. Here is a simple code that encodes a file to 
another file using Base85 encoding:

```csharp
using (var input = File.Open("somefile.bin"))
using (var output = File.Create("somefile.ascii85"))
using (var writer = new TextWriter(output)) // you can specify encoding here
{
  Base85.Ascii85.Encode(input, writer);
}
```

Decode works similarly. Here is a Base32 file decoder:

```csharp
using (var input = File.Open("somefile.b32"))
using (var output = File.Create("somefile.bin"))
using (var reader = new TextReader(input)) // specify encoding here
{
	Base32.Crockford.Decode(reader, output);
}
```

### Asynchronous Stream Mode
You can also encode/decode streams in asynchronous fashion:

```csharp
using (var input = File.Open("somefile.bin"))
using (var output = File.Create("somefile.ascii85"))
using (var writer = new TextWriter(output)) // you can specify encoding here
{
  await Base85.Ascii85.EncodeAsync(input, writer);
}
```

And the decode:

```csharp
using (var input = File.Open("somefile.b32"))
using (var output = File.Create("somefile.bin"))
using (var reader = new TextReader(input)) // specify encoding here
{
	await Base32.Crockford.DecodeAsync(reader, output);
}
```

### TryEncode/TryDecode
If you want to use an existing pre-allocated buffer to encode or decode without 
causing a GC allocation every time, you can make use of TryEncode/TryDecode 
methods which receive input, output buffers as parameters. 

Encoding is like this:

```csharp
byte[] input = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int outputBufferSize = Base58.Bitcoin.GetSafeCharCountForEncoding(input);
var output = new char[outputBufferSize];

if (Base58.Bitcoin.TryEncode(input, output, out int numCharsWritten))
{
   // there you go
}
```

and decoding:

```csharp
string input = "... some bitcoin address ...";
int outputBufferSize = Base58.Bitcoin.GetSafeByteCountForDecoding(output);
var output = new byte[outputBufferSize];

if (Base58.Bitcoin.TryDecode(input, output, out int numBytesWritten))
{
    // et voila!
}
```


Benchmark Results
-----------------
Small buffer sizes are used (64 characters). They are closer to real life 
applications. Base58 performs really bad in decoding of larger buffer sizes, 
due to polynomial complexity of numeric base conversions.

64 byte buffer for encoding
80 character string for decoding

SimpleBase Base85 Z85       | 1.25x  | 1.00µs (2.3x slower)     | 1.86µs (2.6x slower)
SimpleBase Base58           | 1.38x  | 29.99µs (68.6x slower)   | 31.36µs (44.1x slower)

Notes
-----
I'm sure there are areas for improvement. I didn't want to go further in 
optimizations which would hurt readability and extensibility. I might 
experiment on them in the future.

Test suite for Base32 isn't complete, I took most of it from RFC4648. Base58 
really lacks a good spec or test vectors needed. I had to resort to using 
online converters to generate preliminary test vectors.

Base85 tests are also makseshift tests based on what output 
[Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/) produces. Contribution to missing test cases 
are greatly appreciated.

It's interesting that I wasn't able to reach .NET Base64's performance with 
Base16 with a straightforward managed code despite that it's much simpler. I 
was only able to match it after I converted Base16 to unsafe code with good 
independent interleaving so CPU pipeline optimizations could take place. 
Still not satisfied though. Is .NET's Base64 implementation native? Perhaps.
